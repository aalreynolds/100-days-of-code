# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 02 02, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of SQL on datacamp, & started web development 101 on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed learning the basics of SQL, I wish it was free on datacamp though since my session was so short and ended very quickly. I switched over to The Odin project where I went over the basics & installations which installations took much longer than I thought. I am excited to start my first project tomorrow which will be my first rails application.

### Day 2: February 3, 2020 Monday


**Today's Progress**: I continued working with the Odin project

**Thoughts**: Having trouble creating my first rails app.. Not sure if I downloaded some software wrong or what but I need to get to work now.. Hopefully tomorrow I will be done with installations, this is becoming a headache.

**Link(s) to work**: supposed to be cars but it is not working http://localhost:3000/cars 


### Day 3: February 4th, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got past a huge learning curve on the Odin Project.

**Thoughts** Finally was able to make my first rails app worked. I had to uninstall and reinstall a few things.. Soo so happy to finally have figured this out. Officially done with the Installation phase and I will begin Git Basics tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 5th, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Started & Finished Git basics chapter.

**Thoughts** Finishing the basics of git felt super easy compared to the installation chapter. I would like to make notecards from the git basics 2nd page, I won't have time to do that or go over them until I'm finished with this exam/class I have coming up. Also want to add, that I really love doing this & I wish I had more time throughout the day because time seriously flies by when I do this. They say don't let school get in the way of your learning.... my min 1 hour a day of coding is my way of tryng to do this.. I have a very busy/hectic schedule but am still finding a way to make this work.
