# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 02 02, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of SQL on datacamp, & started web development 101 on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed learning the basics of SQL, I wish it was free on datacamp though since my session was so short and ended very quickly. I switched over to The Odin project where I went over the basics & installations which installations took much longer than I thought. I am excited to start my first project tomorrow which will be my first rails application.

### Day 1: February 3, 2020 Monday


**Today's Progress**: I continued working with the Odin project

**Thoughts**: Having trouble creating my first rails app.. Not sure if I downloaded some software wrong or what but I need to get to work now.. Hopefully tomorrow I will be done with installations, this is becoming a headache.

**Link(s) to work**: supposed to be cars but it is not working http://localhost:3000/cars 


### Day 2: February 4th, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
