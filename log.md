# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 02 02, 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learned basics of SQL on datacamp, & started web development 101 on The Odin Project

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed learning the basics of SQL, I wish it was free on datacamp though since my session was so short and ended very quickly. I switched over to The Odin project where I went over the basics & installations which installations took much longer than I thought. I am excited to start my first project tomorrow which will be my first rails application.

### Day 2: February 3, 2020 Monday


**Today's Progress**: I continued working with the Odin project

**Thoughts**: Having trouble creating my first rails app.. Not sure if I downloaded some software wrong or what but I need to get to work now.. Hopefully tomorrow I will be done with installations, this is becoming a headache.

### Day 3: February 4th, 2020 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Got past a huge learning curve on the Odin Project.

**Thoughts** Finally was able to make my first rails app worked. I had to uninstall and reinstall a few things.. Soo so happy to finally have figured this out. Officially done with the Installation phase and I will begin Git Basics tomorrow.

### Day 4: February 5th, 2020 Wednesday

**Today's progress**: Started & Finished Git basics chapter.

**Thoughts** Finishing the basics of git felt super easy compared to the installation chapter. I would like to make notecards from the git basics 2nd page, I won't have time to do that or go over them until I'm finished with this exam/class I have coming up. Also want to add, that I really love doing this & I wish I had more time throughout the day because time seriously flies by when I do this. They say don't let school get in the way of your learning.... my min 1 hour a day of coding is my way of tryng to do this.. I have a very busy/hectic schedule but am still finding a way to make this work.

### Day 5:
February 6th, 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I continued on the Odin project & FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** the Front end section of the odin project directed me to FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification where I mostly skipped HTML since I already know this language and worked on CSS, I got a little more of a 3rd done.

### Day 6:
February 7th, 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I continued on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** as per The Odin Projects Front end chapter I was working on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web design Certification again, I continued on the CSS portion where I got very close to completeing.. probably a little over double than yesterday. I should be done with the CSS portion by tomorrow and begin working on the applied Visual Design portion. At the rate I'm going (an hour a day) I should be done with this FreeCodeCamp section and The Odin Projects Front end chapter by Next friday. I've only been doing an hour a day right now because I'm super busy studying for a final and been training at a new job. I would like to start putting more hours in every day since I have a lot of fun doing this.

### Day 7: Continued on The Odin Project/FreeCodeCamp
february 8th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I continued on The Odin Projects 'The Front End' Section of the Web Development 101 where it directed me to freecodecamp.org to work on their 'Responsive Web Design Certification' section. I finished the basic CSS portion of it & will be continuing tomorrow with the applied visual design portion. I learned about CSS styling, id attrbutes, class attributes, inline style, sizing, & others.

**Thoughts** Feeling good, looking forward to being done with freecodecamps Responsive web design certification section so that I can continue on with The Odin Project but so far, love learning it all! I might go over the HTML basics after finishing freecodecamps web design certification section because I skipped it since I have learned HTML before but I'm thinking it could maybe be a nice refresher.. We'll see!

### Day 8: continued working on freecodecamp
february 9th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued on freecodecamp as per the Odin projects "the front end' sections request. I was on the freecodecamps responsive web design certification again in the applied visual design portion. I got a little less than halfway through this portion. I'm hoping tomorrow I will be finished with this portion... I will still be working on freecodecamps responsive web design certification for about another 4 days or so.

**Thoughts** Feeling good, but again.. very much looking forward to progress. I feel that the odin project focuses more on building a portfolio and freecodecamp mainly focuses on the skills which both are very good but I'm excited to start creating my own work.

### Day 16: Free Code Camp
February 17th, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamps lessons, and now I have to work on the projects to show my knowledge.Finished 1/4 projects.

**Thoughts** Taking longer than I originally thought. Finished the lessons, now I need to start on the projects. I feel like FreeCodeCamp isn't the best for retaining knowledge, TheOdinProject is a bit better at that with their lessons they do. Hopefully I can bust these out quickly and have them look good!
